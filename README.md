# StreetViewer

A simple ArcGIS add-in that opens Google Street View in a browser with a map click.

# Usage

This add-in will place a button in the `Navigate` group on the `Map` toolbar labeled `Open in Street View`. 
Clicking this tool will bring up a cross with which you can click on your map to open those coordinates in your browser in Google Street View.

# Installation

Grab the latest `.esriAddinX` file from the [release page](https://github.com/sfx86/street-viewer/releases) and put it in a path in which ArcGIS will look for Add-ins.
The default is `C:\Users\username\Documents\ArcGIS\AddIns\ArcGISPro\`.
